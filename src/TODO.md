## Task Completed Successfully âœ…

The website has been successfully configured for light mode:

1. **Theme Configuration**: Verified that `data-theme="light"` is set in app.html
2. **Component Cleanup**: Removed hardcoded dark mode classes from:
   - CenteredTextOnlyHero component (removed `dark:text-white`, `dark:text-shadow-lg`)
   - LogoScroller component (removed `dark:invert` and `class:dark` conditional)
3. **Design System Compliance**: Confirmed all components use proper design system variables from theme.css, app.css, and typography.css
4. **Light Theme Variables**: Verified that the light theme uses appropriate color variables:
   - Background: white
   - Foreground: gray-950 (dark text on light background)
   - Cards: gray-50 background
   - Proper contrast ratios for accessibility

The website now displays in clean light mode with proper design system compliance and no dark mode overrides.
